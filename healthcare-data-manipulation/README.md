## Description
Developed a complete SQL-based ETL workflow that stages synthetic healthcare claims data, enriches it with ICD‑10 metadata, validates data quality, and produces analytic‑ready tables, views, and stored procedures. Demonstrates proficiency in relational data modeling, bulk data ingestion, join logic and metadata enrichment, data quality validation, CTE‑based aggregation, healthcare domain coding structures, stored procedure development, and creation of reusable analytic views.
