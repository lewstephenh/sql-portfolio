# SQL Programming Portfolio

Welcome to my SQL programming portfolio! This portfolio demonstrates SQL expertise in data manipulation and educational analysis. It includes programs that transform synthetic healthcare claims data for reporting and research, and build a comprehensive analysis table for high schools to study academic performance in relation to socioeconomic disadvantage. Together, the scripts showcase skills in joins, filtering, aggregation, sorting, and multi‑source integration for practical, real‑world data analysis.

## Featured Project
- **Healthcare Data Manipulation** - This program manipulates synthetic healthcare claims data by joining ICD‑10 descriptions, calculating denial rates by insurance type, filtering for specific diagnoses, sorting records, and creating streamlined subsets for analysis.
- **California High School Analysis Table** - This program constructs a unified analysis table of high schools by integrating enrollment, socioeconomic disadvantage rates, math and ELA performance, and graduation data into a single record per school for comparative study.
